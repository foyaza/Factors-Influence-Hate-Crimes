# Factors-Influence-Hate-Crimes

Motivation

Crimes affect human life in so many ways. Now-a-days, crimes' trend is going up and notably for Hate Crimes. From 2014 to 2018 whole US had a an increasing hate crimes trend which is very alarming for any concerned citizen in US. Lot of times when we watch news or keep an eye on social media; crime news and stories are always there. From that information of increasing hate crime trend I was very interested to see how really the Hate Crime Trend is. Is it true how news and social media post often. Also, I was considering to see what key factors are influencing Hate Crime.


Data Selection

To answer these questions, I utilized FBI UCR program's 10 year data table to gain insight on trend on Hate Crime from 2009 to 2018, and a dataset from fivethirtyeight.com to find influencing factors on hate crimes.


Visualization

Line chart and bar diagram were produced to visualize the trend and scatter plots showed the key factors relationship with hate crimes.


Storytelling

Storytelling is an important part of any data analysis. It was not quite easy to tell story on crime data just in one format. So, I made an interactive R Shiny App which is able to depict hate crime trend for the year 2009 to 2018 with a line chart as well as a sortable data table. The App also shows factors influence hate crimes and how they are statistically related with it. To summarize my story and findings; I also picked some useful insights from my datasets of interest and put them in a slide to present to the audience.
